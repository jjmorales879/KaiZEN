* [10x not 10 %](https://www.bringthedonuts.com/essays/10x-not-10-percent.html)

### Highlights
* Humans innate loss aversion or the tendency to avoid losses to acquire equivalent gains was the main reason Kodak's empire fell. One of Kodak's engineer Steven Sasson actually invented the first digital cameras, however executives immediately
rejected Sasson's invention to avoid losing on film sales.
* Companies are more willing to grow 10% than risk on a 10x opportunity
* Using data to drive opportunities is more important than relying on opinions. 
* Dont let limitations stop you, find ways around obstacles. 
* Spot trends and bet on them.
